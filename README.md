# Storms Database Analysis

Storms and other severe weather events can cause both public health and economic problems for communities and municipalities. Many severe events can result in fatalities, injuries, and property damage, and preventing such outcomes to the extent possible is a key concern.

This project involves exploring the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) storm. The database tracks characteristics of major storms and weather events in the United States, including when and where they occur, as well as estimates of any fatalities, injuries, and property damage. I analyse the database to evaluate which events are most harmful to population health and have the greatest economic impact.

The data analysis showed that tornadoes have the highest impact to population health, whilst floods have the highest economic impact.

In the ShinyApp [folder](https://github.com/aem56/StormsAnalysis/tree/master/ShinyApp) is the code for running my webapp for exploring the data further. Here is a link for the [webapp](https://aem56.shinyapps.io/StormsAnalysis/).
